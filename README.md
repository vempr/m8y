# m8y (Modularity)

is a short 3D Godot game!
I've already said this like 10 times in a row, because it's
really fun to make games for Siege (a 14-week coding challenge, one project every week).

You work for some
random company that decided to buy everyone Framework 13 laptops. For some reason,
your boss wanted you to be the person assembling everybody's laptop with
expansion cards, because they don't care about the mission of the laptop
nor the freedom of their employees.

Anyhow, you are the only person entrusted to do this job.
Your colleagues have sent you messages, and there are ten in total.
Because of the limited time, I couldn't implement slot-specific checks,
so the reviewing process is definitely more forgiving due to that.
Now have fun inserting those cards into the slots!
